The administration was forced to withdraw the decision within 24 hours of issuing the circular after it received flak from employees and was slammed on social media.,\"The Daman and Diu administration on Wednesday withdrew a circular that asked women staff to tie rakhis on male colleagues after the order triggered a backlash from employees and was ripped apart on social media.The union territory?s administration was forced to retreat within 24 hours of issuing the circular that made it compulsory for its staff to celebrate Rakshabandhan at workplace.?It has been decided to celebrate the festival of Rakshabandhan on August 7. In this connection, all offices/ departments shall remain open and celebrate the festival collectively at a suitable time wherein all the lady staff shall tie rakhis to their colleagues,? the order, issued on August 1 by Gurpreet Singh, deputy secretary (personnel), had said.To ensure that no one skipped office, an attendance report was to be sent to the government the next evening.The two notifications ? one mandating the celebration of Rakshabandhan (left) and the other withdrawing the mandate (right) ? were issued by the Daman and Diu administration a day apart. The circular was withdrawn through a one-line order issued late in the evening by the UT?s department of personnel and administrative reforms.?The circular is ridiculous. There are sensitivities involved. How can the government dictate who I should tie rakhi to? We should maintain the professionalism of a workplace? an official told Hindustan Times earlier in the day. She refused to be identified.The notice was issued on Daman and Diu administrator and former Gujarat home minister Praful Kodabhai Patel?s direction, sources said.Rakshabandhan, a celebration of the bond between brothers and sisters, is one of several Hindu festivities and rituals that are no longer confined of private, family affairs but have become tools to push politic al ideologies.In 2014, the year BJP stormed to power at the Centre, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat said the festival had ?national significance? and should be celebrated widely ?to protect Hindu culture and live by the values enshrined in it?. The RSS is the ideological parent of the ruling BJP.Last year, women ministers in the Modi government went to the border areas to celebrate the festival with soldiers. A year before, all cabinet ministers were asked to go to their constituencies for the festival.\"\r",

Malaika responded, \"\"You certainly got to get your damn facts right before spewing sh*t on me...when you know nothing about me.\"\"\",\"From her special numbers to TV?appearances, Bollywood actor Malaika Arora Khan has managed to carve her own identity. The actor, who made her debut in the Hindi film industry with the blockbuster debut opposite Shah Rukh Khan in Chaiyya Chaiyya from Dil Se (1998), is still remembered for the song. However, for trolls, she is a woman first and what matters right now is that she divorced a ?rich man?.  On Wednesday, Malaika Arora shared a gorgeous picture of herself on Instagram and a follower decided to troll her for using her ?alumni? (read alimony) money to wear ?short clothes and going to gym or salon?. Little did he/she know that the Munni Badnam star would reply with the perfect comeback.

Apart from being a successful woman who lives life on her own terms, Malaika has literally played all the roles traditionally prescribed for a woman - she married quite early, had a son and raised him and was always around with the ?khandan?. But then, she got divorced and alimony is the taunt being thrown at her. The details of the alimony are only known to Malaika, her husband Arbaaz Khan and perhaps the family. The couple has handled the divorce with the utmost dignity. But we can vouch for the fact that she did not  need an alimony to buy clothes (short or not, her choice), go on vacations and enjoy her life. If anything, she is as successful, if not more, than her ex-husband.What happened between Arbaaz and Malaika is their personal concern. But to claim that Malaika married and then divorced Arbaaz for money doesn?t hold water. For those who do not agree, please get a course in feminism and for others, here?s a playlist of some of her most popular songs. Follow @htshowbiz for more\"\r",

Earlier, Bihar Health Minister defined virgin as being an unmarried woman and did not consider the term objectionable. The institute, however, faced strong backlash for asking new recruits to declare their virginity in the form.\",\"The Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) in Patna amended its marital declaration form on Thursday, replacing the word ?virgin? with ?unmarried? after controversy.Until now, new recruits to the super-specialty medical institute in the state capital were required to declare if they were bachelors, widowers or virgins.IGIMS medical superintendent Dr Manish Mandal said institute director Dr NR Biswas held a meeting on Thursday morning before directing that the word ?virgin? on the marital declaration form be immediately replaced with ?unmarried?. Dr Biswas had just returned after a four-day leave of absence.Earlier, Bihar health minister Mangal Pandey had ended up redefining the very meaning of virginity in his attempts to justify the awkward phrasing of the question in the form. Following a public furore over the document on Wednesday, the minister told news channels that there was nothing wrong with using the word ?virgin? because it simply meant ?kanya? or ?kunwari? ? which means an unmarried girl.Pandey had joined the cabinet just three days ago.Sources said the chief minister?s office had also taken cognizance of the issue, and asked for a copy of the form. It had even asked why the question was introduced in the first place.In its response, the management of the autonomous super-specialty health facility had clarified on Wednesday that it was in adherence to the central civil services rules followed by the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi.The previous version of the marital declaration form, which purportedly asked new recruits if they were virgins.\r",

A mobile phone app called Rescue Me, which will allow staff to alert police of suspicious behaviour, will be developed. The initiative has been backed by the Maharashtra government.\",\"Hotels in Mumbai and other Indian cities are to train their staff to spot signs of sex trafficking such as frequent requests for bed linen changes or a \"\"Do not disturb\"\" sign left on the door for days on end. The group behind the initiative is also developing a mobile phone app - Rescue Me - which hotel staff can use to alert local police and senior anti-trafficking officers if they see suspicious behavior. \"\"Hotels are breeding grounds for human trade,\"\" said Sanee Awsarmmel, chairman of the alumni group of Maharashtra State Institute of Hotel Management and Catering Technology. \"\"(We) have hospitality professionals working in hotels across the country. We are committed to this cause.\"\"The initiative, spearheaded by the alumni group and backed by the Maharashtra state government, comes amid growing international recognition that hotels have a key role to play in fighting modern day slavery. MAHARASHTRA MAJOR DESTINATION FOR TRAFFICKED GIRLS Maharashtra, of which Mumbai is the capital, is a major destination for trafficked girls who are lured from poor states and nearby countries on the promise of jobs, but then sold into the sex trade or domestic servitude. With rising property prices, some traditional red light districts like those in Mumbai have started to disappear pushing the sex trade underground into private lodges and hotels, which makes it hard for police to monitor.Awsarmmel said hotels would be told about 50 signs that staff needed to watch out for.These include requests for rooms with a view of the car park which are favored by traffickers as they allow them to vet clients for signs of trouble and check out their cars to gauge how much to charge.Awsarmmel said hotel staff often noticed strange behavior such as a girl's reticence during the check-in process or her dependence on the person accompanying her to answer questions and provide her proof of identity.But in most cases, staff ignore these signs or have no idea what to do, he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.RESCUE ME APP The Rescue Me app - to be launched in a couple of months - will have a text feature where hotel staff can fill in details including room numbers to send an alert to police.Human trafficking is the world's fastest growing criminal enterprise worth an estimated $150 billion a year, according to the International Labor Organization, which says nearly 21 million people globally are victims of forced labor and trafficking.Last year, major hotel groups, including the Hilton and Shiva Hotels, pledged to examine their supply chains for forced labor, and train staff how to spot and report signs of trafficking.Earlier this year, Mexico City also launched an initiative to train hotel staff about trafficking.Vijaya Rahatkar, chairwoman of the Maharashtra State Women's Commission, said the initiative would have an impact beyond the state as the alumni group had contact with about a million small hotels across India.The group is also developing a training module on trafficking for hotel staff and hospitality students which could be used across the country.ALSO READFYI | Legal revenge: Child sex trafficking survivors get 'School of Justice' to fight their own battlesMumbai: Woman DJ arrested in high-profile sex racket case\"\r",

A compensation of ?10 lakh was earlier awarded to the victim. The court observed, \"\"It's possible despite the vehicle being driven in permissible limit, an accident can occur when a jaywalker suddenly appears on road.\"\" \",\"In an interesting ruling, the Delhi high court reduced the compensation awarded to a motor accident victim by 45 per cent after it found negligence on the part of both the parties.Deepak Kumar, the victim, was hit by a motor vehicle driven by a government employee named Ajay Kumar in Palam.Deepak told the court that while he was on his way to work, he stopped his vehicle after crossing Palam flyover to feed a cow. While he was crossing the road, he was hit and suffered injuries. The trial court had awarded a compensation of Rs 10 lakh to him after ruling negligence on Ajay's part.Ajay challenged the trial court order based on the detailed accident report that mentioned motorcycle was not being driven dangerously or at an excessive speed, and was being driven in its lane and within the permissible speed limit.He sought examination of the contributory negligence on behalf of the injured through advocate Trideep Pais and Pranav Jain. The court observed, \"\"It is possible that despite the vehicle being driven in permissible limit, an accident can occur when a jaywalker suddenly appears on the road.\"\"\"\"Such people apart from impairing their own lives also pose a threat to the safety and security of the ongoing traffic. The fact that the victim chose to walk across a busy road near the airport, with heavy morning traffic, he knowingly exposed himself to dangers that such risk may entail. It exhibits his negligence towards his own safety,\"\" the court added.Quoting the detailed accident report, the court said if the vehicle was in good condition, being driven in the right lane at the right speed, the accident which was caused at a non-zebra crossing, could be attributed to the sudden appearance of the jaywalker in front of the vehicle.In the circumstances, a portion of the blame and negligence would have to be shared by the claimant. While noting that there was a fair chance of the accident being avoided if the vehicle was being driven at the permissible limit and maintaining fair distance with the vehicle moving ahead of it, the court said, \"\" One has also to bear in mind that not all city roads are carefully marked for pedestrian or zebra crossing.\"\"\"\"The time of the accident was about 9.40 am. The visibility was clear. The appellant could have well seen from some distance the movement of the pedestrian crossing the road,\"\" the court added.\"\r",

       "      <td>New Delhi, Jul 4 (PTI) Producer Ekta Kapoor has said she came up with a \"sassy promo\" for \"Lipstick Under My Burkha\" as she wanted the film to reach out to wider audiences rather than being confined to the art film zone. The movie hit a roadblock with the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) soon after Ekta came onboard as a distributor but it only strengthened her desire to take the movie to the masses. \"The film made me angry. I saw the film and realised we really live in a world where as women we are not allowed to do or say anything. Here was this entertaining movie that spoke about what I think. Why didnt I think of it? I loved it,\" Ekta, 42, told PTI in an interview. She came onboard the project when it had already hit a roadblock. Jha called her to watch the film and asked whether she would like to distribute and she immediately agreed. \"I decided to distribute this movie knowing that I might not earn profits. Then I was hoping we would get a certificate and thats when it landed into a soup with the censor board.\" The board was criticised for being regressive by refusing certification to Lipstick... as the film was \"lady- oriented\". The makers approached the Film Certification Appellate Tribunal (FCAT), which directed the CBFC to certify the film with few cuts. After the film was cleared for release, Ektas team came up with an edgy poster of the film, which depicts a woman showing her middle finger. \"I thought, will this be an artie movie that 200 people will watch or a film where Ill get more and more women to see it? So, we got a sassy promo out, edgy as hell with great Hindi masala music and have more women pay attention to it. I felt this was the way to go forward.\" As someone who has produced shows on TV before venturing into cinema, Ekta understands the duality of the audiences in India. \"Hamare khaane ke daant aur, dikhane ke daant aur hain. What I say in front of my parents, I wont repeat the same with my friends. And we are okay with it. \"This is our society, this is how weve been brought up. But it doesnt mean I dont like discussing such topics. It means I will take up these issues in a different medium at the right time.\" Ekta said lipstick, as a symbol, had less to do with vanity and more to do with freedom of choice. \"When you wear lipstick for vanity, it makes you look good. A lot of women say they wear lipstick when they want to feel good. I read somewhere there is nothing that a right shade of lipstick cant fix. So many acts by us are a form of rebellion.\" Spilling details about the first scene of the film, Ekta said one of the characters goes to a shop and steals a lipstick.</td>\n",

       "2714  New Delhi, Jul 4 (PTI) Producer Ekta Kapoor has said she came up with a \"sassy promo\" for \"Lipstick Under My Burkha\" as she wanted the film to reach out to wider audiences rather than being confined to the art film zone. The movie hit a roadblock with the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) soon after Ekta came onboard as a distributor but it only strengthened her desire to take the movie to the masses. \"The film made me angry. I saw the film and realised we really live in a world where as women we are not allowed to do or say anything. Here was this entertaining movie that spoke about what I think. Why didnt I think of it? I loved it,\" Ekta, 42, told PTI in an interview. She came onboard the project when it had already hit a roadblock. Jha called her to watch the film and asked whether she would like to distribute and she immediately agreed. \"I decided to distribute this movie knowing that I might not earn profits. Then I was hoping we would get a certificate and thats when it landed into a soup with the censor board.\" The board was criticised for being regressive by refusing certification to Lipstick... as the film was \"lady- oriented\". The makers approached the Film Certification Appellate Tribunal (FCAT), which directed the CBFC to certify the film with few cuts. After the film was cleared for release, Ektas team came up with an edgy poster of the film, which depicts a woman showing her middle finger. \"I thought, will this be an artie movie that 200 people will watch or a film where Ill get more and more women to see it? So, we got a sassy promo out, edgy as hell with great Hindi masala music and have more women pay attention to it. I felt this was the way to go forward.\" As someone who has produced shows on TV before venturing into cinema, Ekta understands the duality of the audiences in India. \"Hamare khaane ke daant aur, dikhane ke daant aur hain. What I say in front of my parents, I wont repeat the same with my friends. And we are okay with it. \"This is our society, this is how weve been brought up. But it doesnt mean I dont like discussing such topics. It means I will take up these issues in a different medium at the right time.\" Ekta said lipstick, as a symbol, had less to do with vanity and more to do with freedom of choice. \"When you wear lipstick for vanity, it makes you look good. A lot of women say they wear lipstick when they want to feel good. I read somewhere there is nothing that a right shade of lipstick cant fix. So many acts by us are a form of rebellion.\" Spilling details about the first scene of the film, Ekta said one of the characters goes to a shop and steals a lipstick.   "
